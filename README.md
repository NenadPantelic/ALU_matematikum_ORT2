This project was made as homework project for university course Computer Structures 2.

It was made in <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html">Xilinx ISE tool </a>and Nexys 2 Spartan 3 development board. Matematikum is system that does basic math operations: addition, substraction and multiplication. Whole system was made in Verilog. You're entering operands and operators with buttons and getting result on 7-segment LED displays.

Note: this project was made and tested with Web Pack of ISE software and Spartan 3 Nexys 2 board. There are plenty of boards that are compatible with this program, so you can use this project for them too (maybe you need to change some setup settings or configuration in project).

<p> Clone this repository and open it via ISE Design Suite. You can change button inputs and 7-segment display outputs as you wish. If you do not have Nexys 2 or any similar board that is compatible, you can use simulator in ISE Design Suite. deviceProgramming.sh allows you easy connection and programming of board on Linux.


<pre># Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/NenadPantelic/ALU_matematikum_ORT2
<p># Open it via ISE Design suite if you want to change some things or check source code and implementation

<p># run deviceProgramming.sh for Linux or use Adept programming suite on Windows
$ ./deviceProgramming </p>
